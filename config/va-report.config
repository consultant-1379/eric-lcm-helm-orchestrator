    description: "This service will accept Helmfile.tgz files and apply them to a target cluster. This results in one or more Helm releases installed on the cluster in one or more namespaces, in parallel/sequential groups. Helmfile leverages the helm-diff plugin to find out what Helm releases need to be updated and delegates the execution to Helm itself. To support legacy this service will also accept integration charts for those who haven't migrated to Helmfile yet"
